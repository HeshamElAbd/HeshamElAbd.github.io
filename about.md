Hi there!!, I am Hesham, a PhD student at University of Kiel and University Clinic Schleswig-Holstein and member of the research training group RTG1743: Genes, Environment, Inflammation.

My research topic is the utilization of AI, genetics and high throughput methods like Transcriptomics and Immunopeptidomics to understand the rule of HLA proteins in health and disease.
