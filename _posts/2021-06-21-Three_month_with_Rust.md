Almost three months ago I started coding in Rust and since then, I have  fallen in love with the language. If you used to code in C/C++, most likely, you would love it too. To give more context to the story I think it will make more sense to tell you why I switched to it in the first place. So, the story started years ago while I was mainly coding in C++ and Python. The combination was sweet, I mainly used Python for scripting and non-performance critical stuff and C++ for the heavy lifting. Early this year, I had a heavy computational task where performance was a major bottle neck and hence I had to write the whole project end-2-end in C++. One of the major bottleneck was productivity, development in C++ is slow, compilation becomes slow as the project grows, memory-management becomes tricky, while managing dependencies becomes hell on earth. This period was full of frustration and pain, luckily, during this time I got acquaintance with Rust.
